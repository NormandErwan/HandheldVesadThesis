Our experiment in Section~\ref{sec:experiment} found that the \PhoneInArOut\ condition
was significantly faster and resulted in a significantly smaller
selection count (the less conservative of our two metrics of mistakes),
and was also significantly preferred over the two other techniques.

%Performance of the , however our current implementation without haptic feedback and with a status quo sensing technology (the Leap Motion) was not as good as providing input on the phone.

Section~\ref{sec:concept} also presented mock-ups of multiple uses of VESADs, as well as two novel interaction techniques: quickly rotating the phone to switch the VESAD to alternative information (\autoref{fig:map})
and the ``slide-and-hang'' interaction technique (\autoref{fig:slideToHang}).
