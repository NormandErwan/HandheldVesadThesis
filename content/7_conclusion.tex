Our experiment in \autoref{sec:experiment} found that the \condition{VESAD tactile} condition was significantly faster and resulted in a significantly smaller selection count (the less conservative of our two metrics of mistakes), and was also significantly preferred over the two other techniques.

Performance of the , however our current implementation without haptic feedback and with a status quo sensing technology (the Leap Motion) was not as good as providing input on the phone.

\autoref{ch:concept} also presented mock-ups of multiple uses of VESADs, as well as two novel interaction techniques: quickly rotating the phone to switch the VESAD to alternative information (\autoref{fig:map}) and the \textquote{slide-and-hang} interaction technique (\autoref{fig:slideToHang}).
